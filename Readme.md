This project is a simple house price prediction system built as part of my journey exploring the Machine Learning and Cloud Computing domains. I started by training a machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn, and then converted that notebook-based work into a Flask web application.

The application allows users to enter house-related features through a web interface and get a predicted house price as output. This helped me understand how a trained ML model can be reused in a real-world setting instead of being limited to Jupyter notebooks.

The main goal of this project was learning rather than perfection. Through this, I learned how to structure an ML project, handle preprocessing consistently, load a saved model, and connect everything using Flask. It also gave me clarity on how backend logic, preprocessing, and prediction flow together in an application.

Currently, the project works completely in a local environment. The next step is deploying the application on AWS EC2 to understand basic cloud deployment and hosting.

This project represents my early exploration as a UG1 student and will continue to evolve as I learn more about cloud computing and production-level applications.
